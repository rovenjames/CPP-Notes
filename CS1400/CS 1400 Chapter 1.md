## Computer Systems: Hardware

- Computer hardware components are the physical pieces of the computer
- The major hardware components of a computer are:
    - The central processing unit (CPU)
    - Main memory
    - Secondary storage devices
    - Input and output devices

- The CPU performs the **fetch, decode, execute cycle** in order to process program information
> CPU will fetch the next instruction in the sequence of program instructions from the main memory.
> Instruction is then decoded (originally encoded in the form of a number), generating an electronic signal.
> Signal is then routed to the apprporiate component of the computer, causing it to perform an operation.


## Hardware Main Memory
- Commonly known as **random-access memory \(RAM\)**
- RAM contains:
    - currently running programs
    - data used by those programs
- RAM is divided into units called bytes
- A byte consists of eight bits that may be either on or off
- Bit is either on or off
    - 1 = ON
    - 0 = OFF
- Bits form a pattern that represents a character or number
- Each byte is assigned an address, unique to each byte
> RAM is **volatile** which means that when the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are erased\.
>
>Memory is moved over to **second-hand memory** which is then translated to the main memory when computer is turned on\.

Main memory can be visulaized as a column or row of cells.\
A section of two or four bytes is called a **word**

## Hardware Secondary Storage Devices
- Secondary storage devices are capable of storing information for longer periods of time **\(non-volatile\)**
- Common Secondary Storage Devices:
    - Disk drive
    - External drive
    - CD drive
    - Solid state drive
    - USB drive
    - DVD drive

## Hardware Input Devices
- Input is any data the compuer collects from the outside world
- That data comes from devices known as input devices
- Common input devices
    - Keyboard
    - Mouse
    - Scanner
    - Digital camera

## Hardware Output Devices
- Output is any datat the computer sends to the outside world
- That data is displated 

## Computer Systems: Software
- Software refers to the programs that ru on a computer\.
- There are two classifications of software:
    - **Operating Systems**
    - **Application Software**

>### Computer Systems: Software Operating Systems
>>An operating system is a set of programs that manages the computer's hardware devices and controls their processes
>>
>>Most all modern opearating systems are multitasking
>>
>>A multitasking operating system is capable of running multiple programs a t once
>>- Unix
>>- Linux
>>- MacOS
>>- Windows
>### Computer Systems: Software Application Software
>>Applciation software refers to programs that make the computer useful to the user
>>Application software provides a more specialized type of environment for the user to work in.
>>Common application software:
>>- Spreadsheets
>>- Word processors
>>- Accounting software
>>- Tax software
>>- Games

## Programming Languages
- A program is a set of instructions a computer follows in order to perform a task
- A programming langauge is a special langauge used to write computer programs
- A computer program is a set of instructions that enable the computer to sovle a problem or perform a task
- Collectively, these instructions form an algorithim
- Algorithim is a set of well defined steps to completing a task
- The steps in an algorithim are performed sequentially
- A computer needs the algorithim to be written in machine language
- Machine langauge is written using **binary numbers**
- Each CPU has its own machine language
    - Motorola processors
    - Intel x86 processors
    - ARM processors
